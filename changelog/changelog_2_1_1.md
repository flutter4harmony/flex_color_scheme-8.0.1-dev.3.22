### Archived changelog entry

> The Dart package site [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) restricts the size of the main [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/rydmike/flex_color_scheme/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file size to maximum 128kB. To work around this limitation, older change entries have been moved into individual files linked from the main changelog.

## 2.1.1

**March 30, 2021**

**CHANGE**

* Made the VoidCallback `onSelect` in `FlexThemeModeOptionButton` nullable.
  The optional callback allows for the button to be used for example as a trailing
  widget in a ListTile. Keep it null to not have any callback, nor hover or Ink of its own, and use
  the select event of the parent instead. When it is used as standalone button you
  normally want to use this callback, but not if you want the parent to handle it, that use case was
  not allowed with previous version.
